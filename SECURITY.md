## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Root Bot team takes the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Root Bot, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in Root Bot, please send an email to [wreyor@icloud.com](mailto:wreyor@icloud.com). Your report should include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- The steps to reproduce
- Any relevant versions or other information

### What to Expect

After submitting a vulnerability report, the following happens:

1. We will let you know you received your vulnerability report and send you a more detailed response indicating the next steps in handling your report after the initial review.
2. We will investigate the vulnerability and determine whether it is a valid security issue, a duplicate of a previously reported issue, or not a security issue.
3. If the vulnerability is verified, we will work on a fix and release a security update. We will also publicly acknowledge your contribution in the security advisory unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

### Security Update Policy

We aim to update the project and release patches for security vulnerabilities as quickly as possible after they are reported and confirmed. We prioritize security bugs over feature development and other bug fixes.

### Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Root Bot team and the vulnerability reporter. We prefer to fully disclose the vulnerability as soon as possible after the user has been notified of the vulnerability and a patch has been released
